// 3. Explore strategies for ideating and refining development approaches with AI-driven suggestions from GitHub Copilot.
// 4. Gain direct experience using GitHub Copilot to generate and maintain comprehensive project documentation.
//
// Task 1: Generating a Development Plan
// Objective: Use GitHub Copilot to create and implement a development plan for a sample project.
// Instructions: Start by opening a new document or a README file in your project repository. Begin drafting the outline of your development plan, such as project objectives, milestones, and timelines. As you type, GitHub Copilot will suggest relevant content based on your input.
//
// Task 2: Ideating Strategies
// Objective: Use GitHub Copilot to brainstorm and ideate development strategies.
// Instructions: With the basic structure in place, you can use GitHub Copilot to brainstorm and ideate development strategies. This could involve drafting pseudocode for key features, outlining user stories, or detailing the architecture of your application. Copilot’s suggestions can help you think through different approaches and ensure that no critical elements are overlooked.
//
// Task 3: Integrating AI-Driven Documentation
// Objective: Use GitHub Copilot to integrate AI-driven documentation into your development workflow.
// Instructions: As you code, Copilot can automatically generate comments and documentation for your functions and classes.
